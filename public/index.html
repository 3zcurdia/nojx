          In multiple occasions, I have found myself in need of a web scrapper.
          However, in todayâ€™s digital landscape, every webpage contains some
          form of JavaScript, making it more complex to run a simple web crawler
          like those used in the past. Regardless of the programming language, I
          require a way to wait until the JavaScript is loaded. Consequently, a
          solution like Selenium emerges, which is an excellent tool. However,
          it is a dependency that necessitates a headless browser, typically
          Chrome. This, in turn, increases the server requirements, as running a
          headless browser consumes significant resources and can be costly.
          Additionally, these tools are primarily designed for testing purposes,
          rendering most of their features redundant.
        </p>

          Despite my personal preference for JavaScript, I must acknowledge the
          importance of its ecosystem. In this case, one of the best tools for
          web scraping is Puppeteer. This library does not require any
          configuration to interact with the browser, making it an ideal fit for
          this project. We can scrape HTML from any language and render the
          entire DOM on a browser, thereby reducing the load on other resources
          in a project that requires such tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an initial version, NoJX will simply return the DOM and a
          screenshot, as that is what is currently needed.
